h1. Minimax Demonstrated Using Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby and Lisp

h2. Ruby

To run the ruby version, make sure tictactoe.rb has execute privileges
and run ./tictactoe.rb run.

h2. Lisp

For the lisp version, you need install a Lisp implementation. I use
clisp. On a max, you can install that with "brew install clisp".

After that, +cd+ to the "phase1" directory and run +clisp+ in your
shell. When clisp loads, run +(load 'tictactoe)+

Enter +(exit)+ to end the session.
